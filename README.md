# CentralClass
### CentralClass, the central of functions.

CentralClass, is an project that would be the superset of [CommandEasy-Vanilla](https://github.com/rdb231-com231/CommandEasy-Vannila) (by me lol). I do enjoy to create codes an even more those that help people.
I'm a new Junior Programmer, so don't expect too much.
The thing here is to use my knowledge to create an project that may make easy some lines of code. Example:
  doing an random selector of index in JavaScript sucks. `Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)` it is always the same  
well then, simple. we just need to make an function that stores an `var`iable on the global scope to access it whenever you want, but if you call the function again...
A new value comes!

  We can make too another stuff, such as an `send()` instead of `console.log()`, an repeat function which repeats an callback some times...
  A lot of things can be done! It is cool to create!
  Like, imagine an `reverse()` function which make the array reverse: `[1, 2, 3] => [3, 2, 1]`
  All of this, may be found here. Random functions that does whatever it looks like it does!

examples of in-code functions:

```js

  // randint(min, max) or randnum(min, max);
  // randint(): static; randnum(): normal;
  
Select.randint(5, 7);
// output: 6

const num = new Select(25) // 25: value

num.randnum(20, 35);
// Output: 27

// send(): normal; send in terminal

num.send();

// output(msg): static; send msg to console

Select.output('Hello!');

export function print(msg) {
  return Select.output(msg)
};

```
